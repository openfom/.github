# 🌍 openfom
## *DRAFT*
**Open Future of Mankind** — a public startup collective.  
We build open frameworks and projects to tackle humanity’s core needs, in the open.

---

## 🔑 What we work on
Our work is organized around **areas** — each representing a domain of human progress:

- 🥗 Food  
- 🏠 Housing  
- 🚲 Transportation  
- ⚡ Energy  
- 🤖 Machine Interaction  
- 📡 Communication  
- 🩺 Health  
- 📚 Knowledge  

Every repository in this org is tagged with one or more areas using [custom properties](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-your-team/about-custom-properties) so you can filter and explore by focus.

---

## 📚 Frameworks
We also maintain shared frameworks that guide how we build:
- **Goals Framework** → measurable, adaptive goal-setting  
- **Docs Framework** → variation of Diátaxis for clarity in tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanations  
- **Collaboration Charter** → how we work together (instead of just “code of conduct”)  
- **Financing Models** → exploring sustainable, open funding approaches  

---

## 🤝 How to participate
1. Check our [Discussions](./discussions) to see what’s active.  
2. Join a conversation in an **area** you care about.  
3. Propose ideas, RFCs, or experiments as issues or PRs.  
4. Help us shape the **manifesto** — the living document of our vision.  

No experience required — if you care about the future, you belong here.
